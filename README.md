# large-text-generator

Large Text Generator is a tool that generates long, URL-safe strings of text with no line breaks.

This can be useful for:

* Testing maximum URL length
* Testing compression algorithms
* Any other use case you might come up with :)

Contributions are welcome in the form of bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests, whichever you prefer.
